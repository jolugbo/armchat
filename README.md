A brief read me about the arm project

## Arm Chat Documentation By Olufemi Jolugbo

Project Was developed using hybrid technology, dependencies include 
typescript 
ionic 3 
angular 5
scss
Firebase

*and a lot of will-power :)*.


### Project History:

initially i was going to implement this in xamarin, but i came to realise how buggy things could get when you start adding nuget packages, for each nuget package added, a host of other nuget packages come along as dependencies, and the chaining could be quite lengthy, also one needs to monitor the version of each dependecies in contrast to the class/version device been targeted for installation and the SDK configuration available on the development machine. i ended up spending about 5 days on this, resolving one bug after another and meeting tons of other victims online in a similar situation, needless to say i took the easy way out 

Ionic to the rescue
i decided to take a solution approach instead of a technology approach, using ionic and firebase was quite effective the spead was on-point in delivering the chat messages instantly, and solution came out overnight after a night mixed with redbulls and coffee ( took just a nights work :-), ). Ionic did have its own issues and it was not a straight work in the park but one thing i'll say is there is more power in its community in comparism to the previous tech i used. and that kind of made all the difference
